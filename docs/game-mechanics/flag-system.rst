Flag System
-----------
The flags are stored into a 12008 bit number as taskmask. Because there is no numberic datatype, which can hold up to 12008 bits, the taskmask is splittet up into tiny parts, each 64 bits.
The flag system is used for various stuff, including the minimap and the last VE-Mission.
