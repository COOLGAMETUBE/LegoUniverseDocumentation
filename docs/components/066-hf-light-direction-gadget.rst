HFLightDirectionGadget Component (66)
-------------------------------------

HappyFlower (HF) was the world editor within the game. It seems
to only be attached to a single object responsible for setting
the environment light direction. That object is
`HF Light Direction Gadget <https://xiphoseer.github.io/lu-explorer/objects/6968>`_.
