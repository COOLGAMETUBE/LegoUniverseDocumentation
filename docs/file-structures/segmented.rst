Segmented (.sd0/.si0)
=====================

To download content as needed from the server while playing the game, LEGO introduced a
custom `segmented` file format. The actual files lived in :any:`ff-sd0` files, while the
compression process also generated :any:`ff-si0` files to be used when creating the :doc:`catalog`.

| 	**[L:V]** - compressed (deflate) chunk
