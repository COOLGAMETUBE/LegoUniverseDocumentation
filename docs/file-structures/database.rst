Database (.fdb)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note ::
	There is a converter from fdb to sqlite available, see the :ref:`tools` section. This file type has no relation to firebird database files of the same extension.

.. note ::
	It seems like:
		* Tables are sorted by their name in ascii representation. Uppercase letters then underscore then lowercase letters.
		* Tables themselves are hash maps. Use `id % row_count` to get the appropriate `row_info`, then follow the `linked_row_info` until all entries with that ID are found.
		* When the primary key is a string, a dedicated hash function is used to determin the index of the `row_info` slot.
		* Strings are stored spearately for each row, even if they have the same content. This makes for a great amount of redundancy in the file, but keeps editing simple.

.. todo :: Write some notes regarding the weird block allocation sizes for the structures

.. note :: Since our conventional format wasn’t exactly suited for documenting this format I introduced the “address following” which basically first gets defined by name in a structure description (as underlined text) and is afterwards mentioned whenever that address should be accessed in the file structure when parsing the structure (indicated by an arrow prefix to the underlined name)

.. note ::
	* Address pointers can be -1 which most likely means an invalid address (just skip those)
	* Strings types (TEXT and VARCHAR) are always null-terminated (with some over allocated bytes afterwards it seems, apparently string length are filled to be modulo 4 = 0?)
	* Strings and int64 (BIGINT) types are always stored with an additional address pointer, like this: [pointer]->[data]

.. code-block :: c

	enum DATA_TYPE {
	    NOTHING = 0,  // can’t remember if those are just skipped/ignored or even showed up
	    INTEGER,
	    UNKNOWN1,     // never used?
	    FLOAT,
	    TEXT,         // called STRING in MSSQL?
	    BOOLEAN, 
	    BIGINT,       // or DATETIME?
	    UNKNOWN2,     // never used?
	    VARCHAR       // called TEXT in MSSQL?
	};
